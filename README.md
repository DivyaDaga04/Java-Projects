# Tic-Tac-Toe in Java
This is a simple implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. It allows two players to play the game in the command line by taking turns entering the number assigned to each cell where they want to place their mark. The game ends when one of the players wins or when the grid is full and no more moves can be made. The game checks for winning combinations in rows, columns, and diagonals, and prints the winner (if any) or a message indicating that the game ended in a tie.
